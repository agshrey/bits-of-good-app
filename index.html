            <p>Hi! I'm Shrey, a first-year Computer Engineering student with threads in Distributed Systems and Software Design and Devices.
                Since I was in high school, I've been passionate about making technology accessible to everyone. For example, I've worked on
                an app that delivers financial literacy informamtion and news targeted at students. Additionaly, I've been a tutor for Steel 
                City Codes, a non-profit that teaches coding to underprivileged students. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow!
